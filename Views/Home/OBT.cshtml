                                Just think of it as the new bank, decentralized, independent and instead
                                of earning interest, lending fractionally at x5. That means if you borrow
                                1000 OCC from your users you can lend out 5000 OCC. You can lend out that
                                OCC for whatever project and as soon as you get repayment, you back your
                                lenders and can lend out now at 25000 OCC.

                    <p>
                        Every OCC is a pixelated series of images
                        under grids that can be processed.
                        This allows machine learning to be applied to
                        these grids and tells everyone where demand 
                        is flowing. Is supply for oil going to increase
                        or decrease in the next few months? With Ohni,
                        you'll be able tell and so will everyone else.
                        The power of uniting consumers into a capable
                        union with Ohni banker backing means we change the world
                        together.

                            which OBT they pick and which blockchain
                            they stick to. You can be a charitable

                            giant conglomerates. There will be
